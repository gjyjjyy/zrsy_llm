{terms}-> <title>An Innovative Approach to Improving the Proposed CMS Star Rating "Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes"<\/title> The Statin Use in Persons with Diabetes (SUPD) measure has been adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a display measure for Medicare Part C and Part D plan sponsors and is slated for inclusion within the primary star rating measure set.  As such, the measure has become a focal point for quality improvement efforts by many health plans. Current pharmacy-based interventions reported in the literature  involve pharmacists recommending that a patient's provider issue a prescription for a statin; studies to date have not shown that this intervention has been effective for the majority of patients with diabetes.<\/p>One innovative option is pharmacist rescriptive authority of statins for patients with diabetes. In such a model, a pharmacist identifies a patient with diabetes who is not on a statin, assesses the patient for contraindications and appropriateness of therapy, and works directly with the patient to close the gap in care. This solution could lead to earlier initiation of statin therapy and reduce the burdens associated with multiple communications with the patient's primary care provider. In 2018, Idaho became the first state to allow pharmacist prescribing to close the SUPD measure, with certain regulatory safeguards in place. Copyright (C) 2018, Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy.
